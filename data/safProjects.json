Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Production**: SAF is produced at a certified facility (e.g., Neste Singapore refinery)\n2. **Certification**: The SAF receives sustainability certificates proving its environmental attributes\n3. **Separation**: The physical fuel and its environmental attributes are separated\n4. **Booking**: Airlines or passengers 'book' the environmental attributes (carbon reduction)\n5. **Claim**: The booked attributes are claimed against specific flights, even if the physical SAF was used elsewhere\n\nThis system enables SAF benefits to be applied to flights where physical SAF blending may not be logistically feasible, while ensuring the environmental benefits are properly tracked and not double-counted.",
