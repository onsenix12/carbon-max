# Problem Statement: Changi Airport Carbon Calculator

## Overview

Changi Airport Group possesses world-class operational data infrastructure but deploys a basic carbon calculator that fails to leverage this advantage. The result: the world's best airport for passenger experience ranks mid-tier for carbon management, creating a credibility gap that threatens regulatory compliance, certification progression, and net-zero commitments.

## Customer Segments

### Primary: CAG Sustainability & Operations Teams

**Who they are:** Internal teams responsible for emissions reporting, ACA certification maintenance, and progress toward 2030/2050 targets.

**What they need:** Accurate, auditable emissions data across all scopes. Tools that support ACA Level 4 progression. Real-time visibility into whether CAG is on track against its 20% reduction target (Scope 1&2 by 2030) and net-zero 2050 commitment.

**Current pain:** Manual data aggregation from siloed systems. Scope 3 emissions (81.6% of footprint) estimated through averages rather than measured. No integrated view connecting flight operations, tenant activities, and ground transport.

---

### Secondary: Airport Business Partners

**Who they are:** 100+ airlines, ground handlers, retail tenants, F&B operators, and logistics providers operating within Changi's ecosystem.

**What they need:** Simple way to report their emissions to CAG. Benchmarking against peers. Tools that help them meet their own sustainability commitments.

**Current pain:** No standardized platform for emissions reporting. Each partner uses different methodologies. CAG cannot accurately attribute Scope 3 emissions to specific partners—critical for ACA Level 4 certification.

---

### Tertiary: Passengers

**Who they are:** 67.7 million annual travelers passing through Changi, increasingly aware of aviation's climate impact.

**What they need:** Accurate understanding of their travel footprint. Credible offset/SAF options. Transparency about what their carbon payment actually achieves.

**Current pain:** The existing Changi Carbon Offsets tool uses only 4 inputs (origin, destination, passengers, class) and generic distance-based factors. No aircraft-specific data. No radiative forcing. No SAF attribution. Passengers who care about accuracy have no reason to trust the numbers.

---

## The Problem

### For CAG: A credibility gap between operational excellence and sustainability tools

Changi holds the **World's Best Airport** ranking for passenger experience. For carbon management, it holds **ACA Level 3**—a mid-tier certification that Hong Kong (Level 4), Schiphol (Level 5), and multiple Indian airports have surpassed.

The gap isn't capability—it's tooling.

CAG operates:
- Real-time aircraft tracking across the airfield
- SMART energy meters in every terminal zone
- POS systems processing S$1.1 billion in retail transactions
- Changi App analytics tracking passenger dwell time and behavior

Yet the carbon calculator accepts 4 inputs and outputs a single number.

**The core tension:** CAG has the data to be a leader in aviation carbon transparency. Instead, it offers the same generic calculator as airports with a fraction of its infrastructure.

---

### For Business Partners: No platform for collaborative decarbonization

Scope 3 emissions account for **475,487 tCO2e**—81.6% of CAG's total footprint. These emissions come from aircraft operations, ground service equipment, tenant energy use, and partner activities.

CAG cannot accurately measure what it cannot directly control. And without a stakeholder platform, it cannot:
- Collect standardized emissions data from partners
- Identify highest-impact reduction opportunities
- Demonstrate the third-party engagement required for ACA Level 4

Hong Kong's CAS platform aggregates data from **29+ business partners**. CAG has no equivalent.

---

### For Passengers: Opaque calculations erode trust

The current Changi Carbon Offsets tool (launched November 2023 with Carbon Clicks) generates estimates like:
- Singapore → Bangkok: S$4.33
- Singapore → London: S$34.01

But passengers cannot see:
- Which aircraft type was assumed
- Whether actual load factors were used
- If non-CO2 effects (radiative forcing) were included
- How the offset project was selected

A 2025 Nature study found that basic calculators like ICAO and MyClimate **significantly underestimate** actual emissions compared to comprehensive methodologies. Informed passengers know this. The current tool gives them no reason to believe Changi's numbers are better.

## Existing Alternatives

### What CAG uses today

| Tool | What it does | What's missing |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Changi Carbon Offsets** | 4-input passenger calculator, credit card offset purchase | Aircraft-specific data, load factors, radiative forcing, SAF option |
| **Manual reporting** | Spreadsheet-based emissions aggregation for ACA compliance | Real-time visibility, stakeholder integration, automated data collection |
| **Tenant billing data** | Energy consumption by tenant | Carbon attribution, benchmarking, reduction tracking |

### What the market offers

| Alternative | Limitation for CAG |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **ICAO Carbon Calculator** | Generic methodology, no integration with CAG's operational data |
| **IATA CO2 Connect** | Flight-focused only, no airport activity module, requires airline data sharing |
| **MyClimate / Atmosfair** | Third-party tools, no customization for Changi's unique retail/destination positioning |
| **HKIA Carbon Audit System** | Proprietary to Hong Kong, not available to other airports |

**The gap:** No existing product combines flight emissions calculation with airport activity tracking (retail, F&B, ground transport) while integrating stakeholder data collection. This is precisely what CAG's data infrastructure could enable.

---

## Unfair Advantage

CAG possesses unique assets that no competitor can replicate:

**Data infrastructure already exists:**
- Aircraft tracking sensors monitoring every movement on the airfield
- 260,181 MWh of terminal electricity tracked through SMART meters
- 13+ million retail transactions annually with item-level detail
- Changi App with millions of users and dwell time analytics

**Destination airport positioning:**
- S$1.1 billion retail operation (pre-COVID peak: S$2.8B)
- 50 million annual Jewel visitors, including 20 million non-passengers
- Unique opportunity for non-flight carbon footprinting that operational airports cannot match

**Regulatory tailwind:**
- Singapore SAF mandate: 1% from 2026, 3-5% by 2030
- First-mover advantage on SAF attribution in passenger calculator
- Government backing through Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint

---

## Key Stakes

### If CAG builds this:

**Certification progression:** Clear pathway to ACA Level 4 through stakeholder platform and demonstrated Scope 3 measurement—matching Hong Kong, positioning for Level 5.

**Regulatory readiness:** SAF tracking and attribution built before the 2026 mandate, not retrofitted after.

**Brand alignment:** World's Best Airport for passenger experience becomes a credible sustainability leader, not a laggard.

**Revenue opportunity:** Premium offset/SAF products, potential licensing to other airports, enhanced Changi App engagement.

---

### If CAG doesn't:

**Widening gap:** Hong Kong, Schiphol, and Dubai continue advancing while Changi stagnates at Level 3. The World's Best Airport becomes known for sustainability mediocrity.

**Net-zero credibility crisis:** 2050 net-zero commitment requires measuring and reducing 582,414 tCO2e annually. Without accurate Scope 3 measurement, CAG cannot demonstrate meaningful progress.

**SAF mandate exposure:** 2026 arrives without systems to track, attribute, or report SAF uptake—reactive compliance rather than strategic leadership.

**Passenger trust erosion:** Travelers with climate awareness—a growing segment—see through generic calculators. They offset elsewhere or don't offset at all.

**Stranded data assets:** The SMART meters, aircraft tracking, POS systems, and app analytics continue generating data that goes unused for carbon management.

---

## Problem Summary

**In one sentence:**

CAG's carbon calculator treats Changi like a generic airport, ignoring the operational data and destination positioning that could make it the global standard for aviation carbon transparency.

**The opportunity:**

Build the carbon calculator that CAG's infrastructure deserves—one that leverages aircraft-specific data, integrates stakeholder reporting, tracks airport activity emissions, and positions Changi for ACA Level 4/5 certification and SAF mandate leadership.
