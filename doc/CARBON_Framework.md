## Stage Progression

| Stage | Mode | Key Question | Output |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|
| **C** - Context | Discover | What gap exists between current state and potential? | Problem Statement |
| **A** - Assets | Inventory | What unique resources can we leverage? | Unfair Advantage Map |
| **R** - Recipients | Identify | Who are we solving for, and what matters to them? | Customer Segments |
| **B** - Behaviors | Map | What do they experience today vs. what they need? | Journey Maps |
| **O** - Offerings | Design | What solutions address their specific needs? | Solution Architecture |
| **N** - Next | Plan | How do we build, measure, and evolve? | Roadmap & Metrics |

---

# C | Context

## "What gap exists between current state and potential?"

The first stage establishes **why this problem matters** by identifying the strategic gap between where the organization is and where it could be.

---

### Guiding Questions

- What is the organization known for today?
- Where does it underperform relative to that reputation?
- What external forces make this gap urgent?
- What happens if the gap isn't closed?

---

### Components

#### Performance Paradox
Identify the contradiction between excellence in one area and mediocrity in another.

**Changi Application:**
> "World's Best Airport for passenger experience (12 consecutive years) but only ACA Level 3 for carbon management — a mid-tier certification that Hong Kong, Schiphol, and multiple Indian airports have surpassed."

---

#### Competitive Benchmark
Map the organization against peers on the relevant dimension.

**Changi Application:**

| Airport | ACA Level | Notable Achievement |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| Schiphol | Level 5 | Net Zero, 0.48 kg CO2/pax |
| Hong Kong | Level 4 | 29-partner platform |
| Delhi | Level 4+ | Transition status |
| **Changi** | **Level 3** | **Basic offset tool** |

---

#### Forcing Functions
Identify external pressures that create urgency.

**Changi Application:**
- Singapore SAF mandate: 1% from 2026, 3-5% by 2030
- Net-zero 2050 commitment
- Increasing passenger climate awareness
- Regulatory scrutiny on greenwashing claims

---

#### Stakes Matrix
Articulate what's at risk if the gap persists.

**Changi Application:**

| If we act | If we don't |
|-----------|-------------|
| ACA Level 4 certification | Stuck at Level 3 while peers advance |
| SAF mandate readiness | Reactive compliance scramble |
| Brand alignment (experience + sustainability) | Credibility gap widens |
| Net-zero pathway visibility | 2050 commitment lacks foundation |

---

### Output: Problem Statement

A clear articulation of the gap, who it affects, and why it matters now.

**Reference Document:** [Problem.md]

---

# A | Assets

## "What unique resources can we leverage?"

The second stage inventories **unfair advantages** — assets the organization possesses that competitors cannot easily replicate.

---

### Guiding Questions

- What data do we collect that others don't?
- What infrastructure already exists?
- What market position gives us unique access?
- What capabilities are underutilized?

---

### Components

#### Data Asset Inventory
Catalog data sources, their availability, and their current utilization.

**Changi Application:**

| Data Asset | Volume/Scale | Current Use | Carbon Calculator Use |
|------------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Flight tracking | 366,000 movements/year | Operations | Aircraft-specific emissions |
| SMART meters | 260,181 MWh tracked | Billing | Real-time Scope 2 monitoring |
| POS transactions | 13M+ transactions/year | Revenue reporting | Shopping carbon attribution |
| Changi App users | Millions of profiles | Engagement | Personalized carbon receipts |
| Tenant electricity | Per-outlet metering | Facilities | Tenant benchmarking |

---

#### Infrastructure Map
Identify systems and platforms that can be leveraged or extended.

**Changi Application:**
- Real-time aircraft tracking sensors (airfield-wide)
- Building management systems (HVAC, lighting)
- Centralized POS across 400+ outlets
- Changi App with integrated payments (Changi Pay)
- Changi Rewards program
- Existing Carbon Clicks partnership

---

#### Position Advantage
Articulate unique market positioning that creates opportunity.

**Changi Application:**
> "Changi is a destination airport, not just a transit hub. With S$1.1B in retail sales, 50M Jewel visitors, and passengers who arrive early to shop and dine — we can measure consumption emissions that operational airports cannot."

---

#### Capability Gap Analysis
Identify what assets exist vs. what capabilities are missing.

**Changi Application:**

| We Have | We Need |
|---------|---------|
| Flight data | IATA CO2 Connect integration for load factors |
| Transaction data | Emission factor database for products |
| Tenant energy data | Self-service partner reporting portal |
| App platform | Carbon tracking features |

---

### Output: Unfair Advantage Map

A clear view of what makes this organization uniquely positioned to solve the problem.

**Key Insight for Changi:**
> "Other airports could copy a passenger calculator or stakeholder platform. They cannot copy our merchant emissions module without Changi's retail infrastructure, transaction volume, and destination positioning."

---

# R | Recipients

## "Who are we solving for, and what matters to them?"

The third stage identifies **customer segments** and clarifies what each segment truly needs.

---

### Guiding Questions

- Who experiences the problem most acutely?
- Who has the authority to adopt the solution?
- Who benefits indirectly?
- What does success look like for each segment?

---

### Components

#### Segment Identification
Define primary, secondary, and tertiary users.

**Changi Application:**

| Segment | Role | Primary Need |
|---------|------|--------------|
| **Primary:** CAG Sustainability Team | Own emissions reporting, ACA certification, net-zero roadmap | Accurate data, automated compliance, strategic visibility |
| **Secondary:** Business Partners | Airlines, ground handlers, tenants operating within Changi | Simple reporting, peer benchmarking, recognition |
| **Tertiary:** Passengers | 67.7M travelers annually | Transparency, credible offsets, agency over footprint |

---

#### Needs vs. Wants Matrix
Distinguish between what users say they want and what they fundamentally need.

**Changi Application:**

| Segment | Says They Want | Actually Needs |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Sustainability Manager | "Better spreadsheets" | Automated data aggregation, real-time visibility |
| Business Partner | "Less reporting burden" | Self-service portal, clear value exchange |
| Passenger | "Simple offset option" | Trustworthy calculation, proof of impact |

---

#### Success Definition
Articulate what "solved" looks like for each segment.

**Changi Application:**

| Segment | Success Looks Like |
|---------|--------------------|
| CAG Sustainability Team | ACA Level 4 achieved; board reports generated in hours, not weeks; Scope 3 measured, not estimated |
| Business Partners | Onboarding takes 30 minutes; see own performance vs. peers; get recognized for improvements |
| Passengers | Understand their footprint; trust the numbers; feel agency through offset/SAF choice |

---

### Output: Customer Segments

A prioritized list of who the solution serves, with clarity on their needs and success criteria.

**Reference Document:** [Problem.md — Customer Segments section]

# B | Behaviors

## "What do they experience today vs. what they need?"

The fourth stage maps **current-state journeys** to identify pain points, gaps, and intervention opportunities.

---

### Guiding Questions

- What triggers the user's need?
- What steps do they take today?
- Where do they experience friction, delay, or confusion?
- What emotions accompany each stage?
- Where are the highest-impact intervention points?

---

### Components

#### Journey Mapping
Document the end-to-end experience for each key persona.

**Changi Application — Passenger Journey:**

| Pre-departure | No carbon info at check-in | Missed touchpoint | Uninformed |
| Transit to airport | No mode comparison | Choice invisible | Unaware |
| Shopping & F&B | No footprint visibility | Consumption untracked | Guilt-free (falsely) |
| Post-departure | No follow-up | Moment lost | Disengaged |

**Changi Application — Sustainability Manager Journey:**

| Stage | Current Experience | Pain Point | Emotional State |
|-------|-------------------|------------|-----------------|
| Annual planning | 6+ spreadsheets, 2 weeks | Data wrangling | Frustrated |
| Partner onboarding | Email-based, low response | Manual chasing | Exhausted |
| ACA submission | 3-week scavenger hunt | Evidence assembly | Anxious |
| Board reporting | Manual deck creation | Repetitive, low-value | Underutilized |

---

#### Pain-to-Opportunity Translation
Convert pain points into design opportunities.

**Changi Application:**

| Pain Point | Opportunity |
|------------|-------------|
| Passenger can't see shopping footprint | Transaction-linked carbon attribution |
| Sustainability Manager chases partners for data | Self-service portal with automated validation |
| No real-time emissions visibility | Live dashboard with anomaly alerts |
| ACA submission is manual | Auto-generated compliance package |

---

#### Touchpoint Inventory

---

# O | Offerings

## "What solutions address their specific needs?"

The fifth stage designs **solution architecture** — the specific capabilities, features, and structure that address identified pain points.

---

### Guiding Questions

- What capabilities directly address each pain point?
- How should capabilities be grouped for coherence?
- What's the minimum viable version of each?
- Where does our unfair advantage create differentiation?

---

### Components

#### Solution Pillars
Group capabilities into coherent product pillars, each addressing a segment/need cluster.

**Changi Application:**

| Pillar | Segment Served | Core Problem Solved |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Pillar 1:** Enhanced Passenger Calculator | Passengers | Opaque, generic calculations → Transparent, aircraft-specific |
| **Pillar 2:** Stakeholder Emissions Platform | Business Partners | No standardized reporting → Self-service portal with benchmarking |
| **Pillar 3:** Operations Dashboard | CAG Internal | Manual aggregation → Real-time visibility and compliance automation |
| **Pillar 4:** Merchant & Activity Module | Passengers + Tenants | Flight-only footprint → Complete journey emissions |

---

#### Feature Mapping
Connect features to pain points and pillars.

**Changi Application — Pillar 1 Features:**

| Feature | Pain Point Addressed | Differentiation |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Aircraft-specific calculations | Generic factors mask real impact | Uses CAG's flight tracking data |
| Radiative forcing toggle | Non-CO2 effects ignored | 1.9x multiplier option |
| SAF attribution | Offset-only limits action | First airport to offer SAF in calculator |
| Carbon receipt in app | No post-trip follow-up | Integrated into Changi App ecosystem |

**Changi Application — Pillar 4 Features:**

| Feature | Pain Point Addressed | Differentiation |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Transaction-based carbon | Shopping footprint invisible | 13M+ transactions/year through centralized POS |
| F&B carbon labels | Food choices untracked | Menu-level intensity (opt-in by tenant) |
| Ground transport comparison | Mode choice not quantified | Saved emissions displayed |
| Tenant benchmarking | No peer visibility | Carbon intensity ranking by category |

---

#### Differentiation Matrix
Show where the solution beats alternatives.

**Changi Application:**

| Dimension | Generic Calculators | HKIA CAS | Airline Tools | **Changi Solution** |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Flight accuracy | Distance-based | N/A | High (own flights) | Aircraft-specific |
| Stakeholder platform | ✗ | ✓ (29 partners) | ✗ | ✓ (target 29+) |
| Merchant emissions | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | **✓ (unique)** |
| SAF attribution | ✗ | ✗ | Some airlines | ✓ (airport-level) |
| Regulatory alignment | Generic | HK-specific | Airline-specific | Singapore SAF mandate |

---

#### Build vs. Buy vs. Partner
Determine sourcing strategy for each component.

**Changi Application:**

| Component | Recommendation | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Passenger calculator | Build | Core differentiator, needs CAG data |
| Stakeholder platform | Build | No off-the-shelf fits; HKIA's is proprietary |
| Operations dashboard | Build on BI platform | Leverage existing infrastructure |
| Merchant module | Build | Unique to Changi; core differentiator |
| Flight emission factors | Partner (IATA) | Industry standard |
| Product emission factors | Build + Partner | Start with DEFRA; refine with suppliers |
| Offset projects | Partner (Carbon Clicks) | Verification not CAG's core competency |

## Applying the Framework: Changi Carbon Calculator

| Stage | Key Finding | Document Reference |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **C - Context** | World's Best Airport for experience, mid-tier for carbon (ACA Level 3 vs. competitors at Level 4-5) | Problem.md |
| **A - Assets** | Unique data: 366K flights tracked, 13M+ transactions, S$1.1B retail, 50M Jewel visitors | Problem.md (Unfair Advantage) |
| **R - Recipients** | Primary: CAG Sustainability Team / Secondary: Business Partners / Tertiary: Passengers | Problem.md (Customer Segments) |
| **B - Behaviors** | Passengers: no visibility → guilt without agency / Managers: 80% time on data wrangling | Customer_Journeys.md |
| **O - Offerings** | Four pillars: Passenger Calculator, Stakeholder Platform, Operations Dashboard, Merchant Module | Solution.md |
| **N - Next** | 24-month roadmap to ACA Level 4; Pillar 4 (Merchant) as moat | Solution.md (Roadmap) |

---

## When to Use This Framework

| Situation | How CARBON Helps |
|-----------|------------------|
| Starting a new product | Walk through all six stages sequentially |
| Justifying investment | Use C (Context) and N (Next) for business case |
| Onboarding stakeholders | Use visual summary to explain solution logic |
| Prioritizing features | Map features back to B (Behaviors) pain points |
| Competitive positioning | Use A (Assets) and O (Offerings) differentiation |
| Reviewing progress | Check roadmap against N (Next) milestones |

---

## Framework Principles

1. **Problem before solution** — C and R come before O
2. **Assets inform differentiation** — A shapes what makes O unique
3. **Journeys reveal interventions** — B identifies where O should intervene
4. **Measure what matters** — N connects back to C (closing the gap)
5. **Iterate, don't waterfall** — Revisit earlier stages as you learn
