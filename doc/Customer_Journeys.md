# Customer Journeys: Changi Carbon Calculator

## Overview

Two primary journeys map to the solution's four pillars:

| Persona | Primary Pillars | Key Outcome |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Passenger** | Pillar 1 (Calculator) + Pillar 4 (Merchant) | Understands and acts on their complete journey footprint |
| **Sustainability Manager** | Pillar 2 (Stakeholder) + Pillar 3 (Operations) | Accurate data, automated reporting, ACA progression |

---

# Journey 1: The Passenger

**Persona:** Sarah, 34, Marketing Director based in Singapore. Flies 8-10 times/year for work and leisure. Increasingly climate-conscious but skeptical of greenwashing. Uses Changi App, participates in Changi Rewards.

**Context:** Sarah is flying Singapore → London for a conference. She has a 3-hour buffer at Changi and plans to shop and eat before her flight.

---

## Stage 1: Pre-Departure (At Home / Office)

### Current State (Today)

| Touchpoint | Experience | Pain Point |
|------------|------------|------------|
| Books flight | Sees airline's carbon estimate (if any) | Generic number, no context, easy to ignore |
| Changi App check-in | No carbon information | Missed opportunity |
| Reviews trip | Knows flying is "bad" but doesn't know how bad | Guilt without clarity |

### Future State (With Solution)

| Touchpoint | Experience | Pillar |
|------------|------------|--------|
| Changi App check-in | Sees estimated flight carbon: "Your SQ322 to London: ~1,240 kg CO2e" | Pillar 1 |
| Personalized context | "This is equivalent to 6 months of average car driving" | Pillar 1 |

**Emotional shift:** From vague guilt → concrete understanding

---

## Stage 2: Journey to Airport

### Current State (Today)

| Touchpoint | Experience | Pain Point |
|------------|------------|------------|

## Key Insights Across Both Journeys

### For Passengers (Sarah)

| Insight | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Carbon awareness is episodic, not continuous | Design for moments: check-in, post-purchase, post-departure |
| Guilt without agency leads to disengagement | Always pair information with action options |
| Trust requires transparency | Show methodology, not just numbers |
| Cumulative progress motivates | Build annual tracking, streaks, milestones |

### For Sustainability Managers (David)

| Insight | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| 80% of time is data wrangling, not analysis | Automate collection and aggregation |
| Stakeholder engagement is a bottleneck | Make self-service onboarding frictionless |
| Regulatory deadlines drive urgency | Build compliance workflows into the product |
| Benchmarking justifies investment | Provide peer comparisons where data exists |

### Pillar Coverage by Journey

## Next Steps

These journeys inform:

1. **Feature prioritization** — Which touchpoints have highest impact?
2. **MVP scoping** — What's the minimum viable journey for each persona?
3. **Integration requirements** — Where does the solution touch existing systems (Changi App, POS, smart meters)?
4. **Success metrics** — What do we measure at each stage?
